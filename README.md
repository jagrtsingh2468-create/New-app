# Voice Changer — Study Chaos

A Flutter voice-changer app: record or import audio, apply one of nine
on-device effects, preview, save, and share — all offline, no server.

---

## ⚠️ One important package note

`ffmpeg_kit_flutter` (the package almost every Flutter voice-changer
tutorial uses) was **retired by its maintainer in 2025** and pulled from
pub.dev. This project uses the actively-maintained community continuation,
**`ffmpeg_kit_flutter_new`**, which has the same API. Before building,
run `flutter pub get` and check pub.dev for the latest version number, since
FFmpeg-Kit forks occasionally rename or split (e.g. into "min/audio/full"
build flavors) — swap the dependency line in `pubspec.yaml` if needed.

### Why this structure (Clean Architecture)

- **`domain/`** never imports Flutter or any plugin. It defines *what* the
  app does (`AudioRepository` interface, use cases) without caring *how*.
- **`data/`** implements the domain contracts using real plugins
  (`record`, `ffmpeg_kit_flutter_new`, `audioplayers`, `file_picker`,
  `share_plus`, `shared_preferences`). Swap any plugin later by rewriting
  one service file — nothing else changes.
- **`presentation/`** only talks to the domain layer through use cases /
  the repository interface, injected via `Provider` in `main.dart`.

This separation is what makes the codebase testable and maintainable as it
grows — e.g. you could unit-test `RecorderProvider` with a fake
`AudioRepository` and never touch a real microphone or FFmpeg binary.

---

## How each of the 9 effects works

All effects are implemented as **FFmpeg audio-filter graphs** (see
`lib/core/constants/voice_effects.dart`), run locally via
`ffmpeg_kit_flutter_new` — no audio ever leaves the device:

| Effect | Technique |
|---|---|
| Chipmunk | `asetrate` speeds up + raises pitch, `atempo` corrects overall speed slightly |
| Deep Voice | `asetrate` slows down + lowers pitch, `atempo` compensates |
| Robot | Noise gate + `vibrato` + short `aecho` for a metallic buzz |
| Echo | `aecho` with a single long, fading repeat |
| Reverb | Multiple short-delay `aecho` taps layered to fake a room |
| Alien | Pitch shift + `vibrato` + `chorus` for a wobbly, doubled tone |
| Helium | Aggressive `asetrate` pitch-up |
| Slow Motion | `atempo` < 1, pitch unchanged |
| Fast Voice | `atempo` > 1, pitch unchanged |

## 1. Required Flutter packages

```yaml
provider: ^6.1.2                     # State management
record: ^5.1.2                       # Microphone recording

ffmpeg_kit_flutter_new: ^1.6.0       # Voice-effect processing (community fork)
permission_handler: ^11.3.1          # Runtime permissions
path_provider: ^2.1.3                # App storage directories
file_picker: ^8.0.6                  # Import audio files
share_plus: ^9.0.0                   # Share to other apps
path: ^1.9.0                         # Path utilities
shared_preferences: ^2.2.3           # Local recording-library index + theme setting
uuid: ^4.4.0                         # Unique IDs

lottie: ^3.1.2                       # (optional) micro-animations
intl: ^0.19.0                        # Date formatting
cupertino_icons: ^1.0.8

# dev
flutter_lints: ^4.0.0
```

Install everything with:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

Check `flutter pub outdated` before release and bump to the latest stable
patch versions — pin exact versions in a real production release for
reproducible builds.

## 2. How to build the APK / App Bundle

### a. One-time setup

```bash
flutter --version        # confirm you're on the latest stable channel
flutter doctor           # resolve any missing Android toolchain items
flutter pub get
```

### b. Generate a release keystore (one time only, keep it forever)

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/upload-keystore.jks \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
```

Then create `android/key.properties` (copy from
`android/key.properties.template`) and fill in the real values:

```properties
storePassword=<your password>
keyPassword=<your password>
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=/absolute/path/to/upload-keystore.jks
```

**Never commit this file or the `.jks` to version control** — `.gitignore`
already excludes both.

### c. Build a release App Bundle (required for Play Store)

```bash
flutter build appbundle --release
```

Output: `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

### d. (Optional) Build a signed APK for direct testing

```bash
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi
```

Output: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/`

### e. Verify the signing

```bash
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

## 3. How to publish on Google Play Store

1. **Create a Play Console account** (one-time $25 fee) at
   https://play.google.com/console.
2. **Create a new app** → fill in title, default language, app/game type,
   free/paid.
3. **App content questionnaire**: complete privacy policy URL (required —
   this app records audio, so you must clearly disclose that in your
   policy and that recordings stay on-device unless the user shares them),
   target audience, ads declaration, data safety form (declare "Audio" /
   "Microphone" data collected but not shared with third parties, stored
   locally).
4. **Store listing**: add screenshots (at least 2, phone + optionally
   tablet), a 512×512 hi-res icon, a feature graphic (1024×500), short
   description (≤80 chars), full description.
5. **Production release**: go to *Release → Production → Create new
   release*, upload the `.aab` from step 2c, add release notes.
6. **Set countries/pricing**, confirm content rating questionnaire
   (complete the IARC rating survey — a voice-changer app is typically
   rated for all ages, but answer honestly).
7. **Review and roll out**. Google typically reviews within a few hours to
   a few days for a new app.
8. After approval, the app is live. For future updates: bump
   `version:` in `pubspec.yaml` (e.g. `1.0.1+2` — the number after `+` is
   the required-to-increase `versionCode`), rebuild the `.aab`, and upload
   a new production release.

### Play Store checklist specific to this app
- Microphone permission usage is disclosed in your privacy policy and in
  the Data Safety section (required — Google actively reviews apps
  requesting `RECORD_AUDIO`).
- No third-party analytics/ads SDKs are bundled in this starter project;
  if you add any later, update the Data Safety form accordingly.
- `minSdkVersion 26` (Android 8.0) matches the stated compatibility
  requirement.
- ProGuard/R8 minification is already enabled in `android/app/build.gradle`
  release build type, keeping the release build small.

## Making it Play-Store-ready from just a phone (no laptop)

The project ships with two Codemagic workflows in `codemagic.yaml`:
- **`android-release`** — builds a properly **signed `.aab`**, the format
  Play Console requires. Use this one to publish.
- **`android-apk-debug`** — builds a quick debug-signed `.apk` for testing
  on your own phone. Not valid for Play Store.

Everything below is done through websites in your phone's browser —
no terminal, no laptop.

### a. Generate your release keystore in Codemagic (no `keytool` needed)

1. Log into codemagic.io, go to **Team settings → Code signing identities
   → Android keystores**.
2. Tap **Generate keystore** (or "Upload" if you already have one from a
   desktop). Codemagic can create a brand-new keystore for you right in
   the browser, store it securely, and never show you the raw file.
3. Name the reference **`voice_changer_release`** — this must exactly
   match the name in `codemagic.yaml`'s `android_signing:` list.
4. Save the alias/passwords Codemagic shows you somewhere safe (a notes
   app, password manager). **If you lose this keystore later, you can
   never update your published app again** — Play Store requires every
   update to be signed with the same key forever.

### b. Run the release build

1. In Codemagic, open your app → you'll now see two workflows in the
   dropdown at the top: **"Voice Changer - Play Store Release (AAB)"**
   and **"Voice Changer - Quick Test APK"**.
2. Select **Play Store Release (AAB)** → **Start new build**.
3. When it finishes, download the `.aab` from the build's Artifacts
   section. This is the file you upload to Play Console — not an APK.

### c. Publish on Google Play Console (all via browser)

1. Go to play.google.com/console, pay the one-time $25 registration fee
   if you haven't already, and create a developer account.
2. **Create app** → fill in name, language, app/game, free/paid.
3. **Set up your app** checklist — work through each item:
   - **Privacy policy**: you need a URL. If you don't have a website,
     use a free option like a Google Sites page or a GitHub Pages page
     describing what data the app accesses (microphone) and stating
     recordings stay on-device unless the user shares them.
   - **App access**: say the app has no restricted access (no login).
   - **Ads**: declare no ads (this build has none).
   - **Content rating**: complete the questionnaire — a voice-changer
     app with no violence/gambling typically rates "Everyone".
   - **Target audience**: select an appropriate age range.
   - **Data safety**: declare that the app collects **Audio** data
     (microphone recordings), that it's **not shared with third
     parties**, and is stored **on-device**.
   - **Store listing**: add a short description, full description, app
     icon (512×512 PNG), a feature graphic (1024×500), and 2+
     screenshots. You can take screenshots straight from your phone
     after installing the debug APK, and design the feature graphic in
     a free phone app like Canva.
4. **Production → Create new release**, upload the `.aab` from step (b),
   write release notes, save, then **Review release** and **Start
   rollout to Production**.
5. Google typically reviews new apps within a few hours to a couple of
   days. You'll get an email when it's approved and live.

### d. Publishing updates later

Bump the version in `pubspec.yaml` (e.g. `1.0.0+1` → `1.0.1+2` — the
number after `+` must always increase), push to GitHub, let Codemagic
rebuild, and upload the new `.aab` as a new Production release. Because
the keystore lives permanently in Codemagic under the same reference
name, every future build is automatically signed the same way — you
don't need to regenerate anything.

### App icon

A branded launcher icon is already included at `assets/icon/icon.png`
(violet-to-teal gradient with a microphone + sound-wave mark, matching the
app's color scheme). `flutter_launcher_icons` is wired into
`pubspec.yaml`, and both Codemagic workflows run
`dart run flutter_launcher_icons` automatically before every build, so
every mipmap density and the adaptive-icon variant are generated fresh
each time — you don't need to do anything by hand.

If you'd rather use your own logo later, just replace
`assets/icon/icon.png` with a 1024×1024 PNG and push — the next build
regenerates everything.



- FFmpeg processing runs once per effect selection (not continuously),
  and only while the app is foregrounded — no background CPU usage.
- Recording uses AAC-LC at a modest 128kbps/44.1kHz mono, keeping both
  file sizes and encoding CPU load low.
- The waveform UI is a lightweight procedural visualization rather than
  full PCM decoding, avoiding unnecessary decode overhead just to draw a
  preview.

## Running locally

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Grant microphone permission when prompted on first recording attempt.
